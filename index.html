        Sports play a vital role in shaping both physical and mental health. From childhood
        to professional life, sports help individuals develop discipline, teamwork, leadership,
        and resilience. In today’s fast-paced digital world, sports are not just games; they are
        global events followed by millions of fans across continents.

        Cricket, football, and tennis are among the most popular sports worldwide. Each of
        these sports has its own history, culture, and passionate fan base. Cricket dominates
        countries like Pakistan, India, England, and Australia, while football enjoys global
        popularity with leagues like the English Premier League, La Liga, and the FIFA World Cup.
        Tennis, on the other hand, represents elegance, endurance, and individual excellence.

        sports communities more interactive and engaging.
